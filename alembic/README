Generic single-database configuration with an async dbapi.

A generic Alembic environment is configured.

This environment makes the following assumptions:

- This is a generic single-database environment
- Only asynchronous database drivers are used

The environment is configured to run against a async DBAPI specified
by the `sqlalchemy.url` configuration variable. For example, to use
an async postgresql driver:

    sqlalchemy.url = postgresql+asyncpg://scott:tiger@localhost/mydb

The `asyncio` mode requires that the migration scripts are run using `alembic ...`
with `--async` flag. Or set `asyncio_mode=True` in alembic.ini.
